Nokia ’s transition to a primary focus on telecommunications began in the 1990s. The first GSM call was made in 1991 using Nokia equipment. Rapid success in the mobile phone sector allowed Nokia to become by 1998, the best-selling mobile phone brand in the world. In 2003 Nokia introduced the first camera phone. In 2011, to address increasing competition from iOS and Android operating systems, Nokia entered into a strategic partnership with Microsoft. In 2014 Nokia sold its mobile and devices division to Microsoft. The creation of Nokia Networks, following the buy-out of joint-venture partner Siemens in 2013, laid the foundation for Nokia ’s transformation into primarily a network hardware and software provider. The 2015 acquisition of Franco-American telecommunications equipment provider Alcatel-Lucent greatly broadened the scope of Nokia ’s portfolio and customer base. Additional acquisitions have positioned Nokia to be a global technology leader in the communications industry. In 2016 the Nokia brand re-entered the mobile handset market through a licensing agreement with HMD Global, allowing them to offer phones under the Nokia brand. MISSION Nokia wants to create a new world; to transform a big planet to a small village. Their vision is to create, build, and encourage people from all countries to communicate with each other in order to create a world where everybody is connected.

The goods shall be returned by the consumer in accordance with the provisions of article 6.2 of the General Terms and Conditions. The above-mentioned right of withdrawal shall not apply to goods: which were made by ETT in accordance with the consumer’s specifications, which cannot be returned due to the nature of the goods, which are liable to deteriorate or expire rapidly, of which the price is dependent on fluctuations in the financial market which cannot be controlled by the company or of which the consumer broke the seals. 1.2. In the event that the buyer is a consumer in the sense of article I.1.2° of the Belgian Code of Economic Law and/or article 1649bis of the Belgian Civil Code and article 2.1 of the European Directive 2011/83/EU, these general terms and conditions shall apply with the exception of the following articles: 4, 6.2, 6.4, 12,1. ARTICLE 2: APPLICABLE TERMS AND CONDITIONS: These general terms and conditions apply to any quotation or offer made by ETT as well as to any agreement between ETT and the buyer. By placing an order, the buyer confirms to have taken cognizance of these general terms and conditions in a language he understands and to accept these general terms and conditions entirely, without any reservation. The fact that ETT did not explicitly object to the buyer’s general terms and conditions or other specifications on the buyer’s documents or made no reservation with respect hereto upon the acceptance of the order (or several orders) does not affect the preceding and the application of these general terms and conditions. ARTICLE 3: REALIZATION OF THE AGREEMENT: 3.1. The sale is realized at the moment the buyer receives from ETT a confirmation of the order. 3.2. Any quotation/offer may be withdrawn by ETT until the acceptance by the buyer. 3.3.

ARTICLE 4: DELIVERY PERIODS: The delivery periods specified in any way by ETT are only indicative and therefore not binding. ARTICLE 5: DELIVERY: 5.1.

The customer covenants and agrees to accept the goods on the agreed delivery date. If the goods are not accepted in due time by the customer, ETT may consider the agreement terminated without further notice or default or any other notice and without prior authorization, and sell the goods.

ETT shall be informed of any hidden defects by registered letter within five days after the discovery. In any case and without prejudice to more severe provisions of the manufacturer and/or importer, the guarantee period is limited to one year after delivery. The guarantee provided by ETT is always limited to the guarantee offered by ETT’s supplier, the manufacturer and/or importer. The buyer shall fulfil all formalities with respect hereto. In the event a defect is ascertained, the buyer shall ask ETT an RMA number. The RMA number must be mentioned clearly when the goods are returned, in the original packaging, together with a copy of the sales invoice issued by ETT. All transport expenses in the context of the guarantee shall be paid by the buyer. When afterwards the buyer is offered adequate goods (repaired or replaced), the buyer may not demand the rescission of the sale or claim damages. CPUs as well as goods subject to wear and tear are not covered by the guarantee. The value of the guarantee commitment shall not exceed the value of the sale and the agreement. 6.3. ETT shall not be bound to give indemnity if the buyer transformed or changed the goods or had them repaired without ETT’s prior written consent or in case of the abnormal or improper use of the goods by the buyer or the lack of maintenance according to the instructions of the supplier. 6.4. In case ETT is obliged to give indemnity, ETT may at its own discretion replace these items free of charge (after which the replaced items become ETT’s property) or repair them or grant a discount. ARTICLE 7: LIABILITY: ETT is only liable for any damage directly resulting from a proven error and not for any indirect damage or any damage resulting from liability towards third parties. The liability of ETT is in any case limited to the price of the order. ARTICLE 8: PRICE: 8.1. The price of the goods is the price specified in the order confirmation. 8.2. In case of a price increase between the date of the order and the date of the delivery as a result of a change in the exchange rate or a change in taxes or duties on the goods, ETT may pass on these amounts to the customer, without granting the buyer the right to claim the rescission of the sale. ARTICLE 9: PAYMENT: 9.1. Orders shall be paid immediately at the moment of the realization of the agreement in accordance with article 3.1 of these general terms and conditions. The payment shall be settled through SWIFT and in the currency mentioned on the order confirmation or on the invoice. Each party shall bear its own bank costs. 9.2. In case of non-payment or late payment, ETT may terminate the agreement immediately without prior notice of default or any other notice and without any prior court authorization, and sell the goods. In that case, the customer shall pay lump-sum damages of 15% of the order, without prejudice to the right of ETT to claim higher damages in case more damage was actually caused. 9.3. If ETT prefers not to terminate the agreement immediately as described above, the buyer shall pay ETT, by operation of law and without any further notice as from the due date, a late payment interest amounting to 0.75% per day of the unpaid amount in view of the specific trading activity, without prejudice to ETT’s right to claim higher damages in case more damage was actually caused. Also a delay in the payment shall by operation of law and without any further notice result in damages amounting to 15% of the invoice, without prejudice to ETT’s right to claim higher damages in case more damage was actually caused. 9.4. On pain of nullity, ETT shall be informed of any disputes concerning the invoice within 5 days from the date of the invoice. ARTICLE 10: TRANSFER OF OWNERSHIP AND RISK: 10.1.

What started with a 35mm camera and a wrist strap made from old wetsuits and plastic scraps has grown into an international company that has sold over 26 million GoPro cameras in more than 100 countries. But it’s the millions of passionate GoPro users around the globe who bring the magic to life. They humble and inspire us every day with incredible creativity that helps us see the world in an all-new way—and fires us up to keep creating the most awesome, innovative products possible.

The company was set up to manufacture consumer electronics and home appliances for the local market after the Korean War. Therefore, it was the first to produce radio equipment, televisions, refrigerators, washing machines and air conditioners in South Korea. While the company initially operated under the GoldStar branding, it was later merged with Lucky Chemical and LS Cable –other LG group companies – in 1995. The company’s first overseas production facility was set up in the US in 1982. In 1994 GoldStar officially became LG Electronics . To expand its footprint in the US, LG acquired US-based television manufacturer Zenith and also launched the world’s first CDMA digital mobile phone in 1995. In 1999, the company made a joint venture with Philips, now known as LG Display, to design and develop liquid crystal displays (LCDs). LG Electronics made a significant contribution to the world’s consumer electronics and home appliances industry. In 2005, it became one of the top 100 global brands in consumer electronics. As of 2009, its display manufacturing unit, LG Display, had become the world’s largest LCD panel manufacturer. The company started making smartphones in 2010. It was one of the early original equipment manufacturers to adopt Google’s Android as default operating system for its smartphones. In 2014, in partnership with Google, the company also announced the Android Wear-based LG G Watch. The next year, the company launched the LG Watch Urbane, the first LG watch to support smartwatch features such as WiFi. Today, LG Electronics is a global brand that manufactures and sells consumer electronics, mobile communications, and home appliances. In addition, the company also makes commercial display solutions, solar solutions, energy storage systems, energy management solutions, membranes, stylers and lighting products, besides compressors and motors. MISSION LG 's vision is to become the market leading company with broad market recognition.

Nokia ’s transition to a primary focus on telecommunications began in the 1990s. The first GSM call was made in 1991 using Nokia equipment. Rapid success in the mobile phone sector allowed Nokia to become by 1998, the best-selling mobile phone brand in the world. In 2003 Nokia introduced the first camera phone. In 2011, to address increasing competition from iOS and Android operating systems, Nokia entered into a strategic partnership with Microsoft. In 2014 Nokia sold its mobile and devices division to Microsoft. The creation of Nokia Networks, following the buy-out of joint-venture partner Siemens in 2013, laid the foundation for Nokia ’s transformation into primarily a network hardware and software provider. The 2015 acquisition of Franco-American telecommunications equipment provider Alcatel-Lucent greatly broadened the scope of Nokia ’s portfolio and customer base. Additional acquisitions have positioned Nokia to be a global technology leader in the communications industry. In 2016 the Nokia brand re-entered the mobile handset market through a licensing agreement with HMD Global, allowing them to offer phones under the Nokia brand. MISSION Nokia wants to create a new world; to transform a big planet to a small village.

For safety reasons, we prefer delivering the goods on hold to a “third party” warehouse near your address. You can inspect the goods at this warehouse, before executing the payment. Upon receipt of your payment, the goods will be handed over to you by a release fax so you can arrange the picking-up. The person or transport company, authorized to accept the goods, should sign the transport documents and release fax with date, full name and signature. Please make sure that there is also a company stamp available in order to stamp these documents. If there is, by exception, no company stamp available we ask for a copy of the identification or driving license of the person picking up the goods. If delivery in a warehouse is really impossible for you, we can deliver at your address after we have certainty of payment.

Applicable conditions 1.1 These General Conditions of Purchase apply to all requests for quotations, orders and agreements concerning the supply of goods for the benefit of ETT. Any deviations from or additions to these General Conditions of Purchase require ETT’s prior explicit and written consent. 1.2 The acceptance of the order of ETT by supplier implies acceptance of the General Conditions of Purchase of ETT. The General Conditions of Purchase are applicable, with exclusion of the general conditions of sale of the supplier. 2.

The acceptance of deliveries or supplies by ETT as well as possible down payments made in this regard will not imply acknowledgement of any deviations.

Possible down payments will be immediately reimbursed to ETT. 2.4 The supplier guarantees that he is the owner of the goods on the date that ETT places the order.

Nokia ’s transition to a primary focus on telecommunications began in the 1990s. The first GSM call was made in 1991 using Nokia equipment. Rapid success in the mobile phone sector allowed Nokia to become by 1998, the best-selling mobile phone brand in the world. In 2003 Nokia introduced the first camera phone. In 2011, to address increasing competition from iOS and Android operating systems, Nokia entered into a strategic partnership with Microsoft. In 2014 Nokia sold its mobile and devices division to Microsoft. The creation of Nokia Networks, following the buy-out of joint-venture partner Siemens in 2013, laid the foundation for Nokia ’s transformation into primarily a network hardware and software provider. The 2015 acquisition of Franco-American telecommunications equipment provider Alcatel-Lucent greatly broadened the scope of Nokia ’s portfolio and customer base. Additional acquisitions have positioned Nokia to be a global technology leader in the communications industry. In 2016 the Nokia brand re-entered the mobile handset market through a licensing agreement with HMD Global, allowing them to offer phones under the Nokia brand. MISSION Nokia wants to create a new world; to transform a big planet to a small village. Their vision is to create, build, and encourage people from all countries to communicate with each other in order to create a world where everybody is connected.

The company was set up to manufacture consumer electronics and home appliances for the local market after the Korean War. Therefore, it was the first to produce radio equipment, televisions, refrigerators, washing machines and air conditioners in South Korea. While the company initially operated under the GoldStar branding, it was later merged with Lucky Chemical and LS Cable –other LG group companies – in 1995. The company’s first overseas production facility was set up in the US in 1982. In 1994 GoldStar officially became LG Electronics . To expand its footprint in the US, LG acquired US-based television manufacturer Zenith and also launched the world’s first CDMA digital mobile phone in 1995. In 1999, the company made a joint venture with Philips, now known as LG Display, to design and develop liquid crystal displays (LCDs). LG Electronics made a significant contribution to the world’s consumer electronics and home appliances industry. In 2005, it became one of the top 100 global brands in consumer electronics. As of 2009, its display manufacturing unit, LG Display, had become the world’s largest LCD panel manufacturer. The company started making smartphones in 2010. It was one of the early original equipment manufacturers to adopt Google’s Android as default operating system for its smartphones. In 2014, in partnership with Google, the company also announced the Android Wear-based LG G Watch. The next year, the company launched the LG Watch Urbane, the first LG watch to support smartwatch features such as WiFi. Today, LG Electronics is a global brand that manufactures and sells consumer electronics, mobile communications, and home appliances. In addition, the company also makes commercial display solutions, solar solutions, energy storage systems, energy management solutions, membranes, stylers and lighting products, besides compressors and motors.

Terugzending van het goed door de consument dient te gebeuren conform de bepalingen opgenomen in artikel 6.2 van deze algemene voorwaarden. Het bovengenoemd herroepingsrecht geldt niet voor goederen: die door ETT zijn tot stand gebracht overeenkomstig de specificaties van de consument, die door hun aard niet kunnen worden teruggezonden, die snel kunnen bederven of verouderen, waarvan de prijs gebonden is aan schommelingen op de financiële markt waarop de onderneming geen invloed heeft of waarvan de consument de verzegeling heeft verbroken. 1.2 In het geval de koper een consument is in de zin van artikel I.1 2° van het Wetboek van economisch recht en/of artikel 1649bis van het Burgerlijk wetboek, gelden deze algemene voorwaarden met uitzondering van volgende artikelen: 4, 6.2, 6.4, 12.1. ARTIKEL 2: TOEPASSELIJKE VOORWAARDEN: Deze algemene voorwaarden zijn van toepassing op iedere aanbieding of offerte uitgaand van ETT alsook op iedere overeenkomst tussen ETT en de koper. De koper verklaart door de plaatsing van een bestelling van deze algemene voorwaarden kennis te hebben genomen in een voor hem begrijpbare taal en deze integraal te aanvaarden zonder enig voorbehoud. Het feit dat ETT de algemene voorwaarden of andere aanduidingen van de koper op eigen documenten niet uitdrukkelijk heeft geprotesteerd of daarvoor geen voorbehoud heeft gemaakt bij aanvaarding van het order (of meerdere orders) doet geen afbreuk aan het voorgaande en de toepassing van deze algemene voorwaarden. ARTIKEL 3: TOTSTANDKOMING OVEREENKOMST: 3.1 De aankoop komt tot stand op het ogenblik dat de koper een bevestiging van de geplaatste bestelling ontvangt van ETT . 3.2 Elk aanbod/offerte kan worden ingetrokken door ETT tot aan de aanvaarding door de koper. 3.3 ETT is wat de juistheid, actualiteit of volledigheid van de aangeboden informatie betreft, slechts gehouden tot een middelenverbintenis. ETT is in geen geval aansprakelijk in geval van materiële fouten of drukfouten. 3.4 Elke annulering van de bestelling door de koper dient schriftelijk te gebeuren en is slechts geldig mits schriftelijke aanvaarding door ETT (behoudens hetgeen vermeld in artikel 1.1 in geval van een consumentenkoop op afstand). In geval van gehele of gedeeltelijke annulering is de koper een forfaitaire vergoeding van 15 % van de prijs van de bestelling verschuldigd, onverminderd het recht van ETT op een hogere vergoeding in geval van een hogere werkelijk geleden schade waarbij de koper een rendementsverlies van 0,75% per dag aanvaardt op de waarde van de bestelde goederen. Betaalde voorschotten worden ingehouden en verrekend door ETT met voornoemde verschuldigde vergoedingen. ARTIKEL 4: LEVERINGSTERMIJNEN: De door ETT op gelijk welke wijze meegedeelde leveringstermijnen zijn louter indicatief en zijn derhalve niet bindend. ARTIKEL 5: LEVERING: 5.1. Behoudens andersluidend schriftelijk akkoord tussen partijen, geschiedt de levering DDP. Iedere aansprakelijkheid van ETT is beperkt tot het bedrag dat in het desbetreffende geval uit hoofde van de door haar gesloten verzekering wordt uitbetaald. 5.2 . De klant verbindt zich ertoe de goederen in ontvangst te nemen op de overeengekomen leveringsdatum. Indien de goederen niet tijdig door de klant in ontvangst worden genomen, is ETT gerechtigd de overeenkomst zonder voorafgaande ingebrekestelling noch kennisgeving en zonder voorafgaande machtiging als ontbonden te beschouwen en de goederen door te verkopen. In dergelijk geval is de klant een forfaitaire vergoeding van 15% van de prijs van de bestelling verschuldigd, onverminderd het recht van ETT op een hogere vergoeding in geval van een hogere werkelijk geleden schade waarbij de koper een rendementsverlies van 0,75% per dag aanvaardt op de waarde van de bestelde goederen. ARTIKEL 6: NAZICHT, CONFORMITEIT EN GARANTIE: 6.1. Eventuele klachten met betrekking tot de conformiteit van de goederen zijn alleen ontvankelijk zo deze worden vermeld in het inspectierapport opgemaakt bij de levering of op het ontvangstbewijs van de transporteur. 6.2. Verborgen gebreken dienen per aangetekend schrijven te worden gemeld aan ETT binnen de vijf dagen na ontdekking. In elk geval en onverminderd de strengere bepalingen van de fabrikant en/of invoerder is de garantieperiode beperkt tot één jaar na levering. De door ETT verstrekte garantie is steeds beperkt tot deze welke wordt geboden door de leverancier van ETT, de constructeur en/of invoerder. De koper is verplicht dienaangaande alle formaliteiten te vervullen. Bij vastgesteld gebrek dient de koper een RMA-nummer aan te vragen bij ETT. De goederen moeten worden teruggestuurd met duidelijke vermelding van het RMA-nummer, in de originele verpakking en met een kopie van de verkoopfactuur van ETT. Alle transportkosten in het kader van de garantie zijn ten laste van de koper. De koper kan in geval van een naderhand aanbod van een conform (herstelde of vervangen) zaak, geen ontbinding van de koop noch schadevergoeding eisen. CPU’s alsook slijtageartikelen vallen buiten elke waarborg. In geen geval kan de waarde van de garantieverbintenis de waarde van de aankoop en de overeenkomst overschrijden. 6.3 ETT BVBA is in geen geval gehouden tot vrijwaring indien de koper de goederen heeft omgevormd, veranderd of heeft laten herstellen zonder voorafgaande schriftelijke goedkeuring van ETT of in het geval van abnormaal of foutief gebruik van de goederen door de koper of gebrek aan onderhoud volgens de voorschriften van de leverancier. 6.4 In het geval ETT gehouden zou zijn tot vrijwaring, zal zij naar keuze de desbetreffende zaken gratis vervangen (waarna de vervangen zaken haar eigendom worden) of herstellen dan wel een prijsreductie verlenen. ARTIKEL 7: AANSPRAKELIJKHEID: ETT is slechts aansprakelijk voor de schade die het rechtstreeks gevolg is van een concreet bewezen fout en is niet aansprakelijk voor indirecte schade van welke aard ook noch schade als gevolg van aansprakelijkheid jegens derden. De aansprakelijkheid van ETT is in elk geval beperkt tot de prijs van de bestelling. ARTIKEL 8: PRIJS: 8.1. De prijs van de goederen is deze zoals aangeduid op de orderbevestiging. 8.2 Indien tussen de datum van het plaatsen van de bestelling en de datum van levering een prijsverhoging mocht optreden ingevolge koerswijziging of een wijziging in eender welke belasting of taks op de koopwaar, zal deze door ETT steeds mogen doorgerekend worden, zonder het recht van de koper om daarvoor ontbinding van de overeenkomst te vorderen. ARTIKEL 9: BETALING: 9.1 Elke bestelling is onmiddellijk betaalbaar op het moment van totstandkoming van de overeenkomst conform artikel 3.1 van deze algemene voorwaarden. De betaling dient te gebeuren SWIFT en in de valuta vermeld op de orderbevestiging of factuur waarbij elke partij de eigen bankkosten draagt. 9.2 In geval van niet of laattijdige betaling is ETT gerechtigd de overeenkomst onmiddellijk zonder voorafgaande ingebrekestelling noch kennisgeving en zonder voorafgaandelijke rechterlijke machtiging als ontbonden te beschouwen en de goederen door te verkopen. In dergelijk geval is de klant een forfaitaire schadevergoeding van 15% van de prijs van de bestelling verschuldigd, onverminderd het recht van ETT op een hogere vergoeding in geval van een hogere werkelijk geleden schade. 9.3 In geval ETT niet opteert voor de onmiddellijke ontbinding van de overeenkomst zoals hierboven omschreven, is de koper vanaf de vervaldag tot betaling van rechtswege en zonder voorafgaande ingebrekestelling een verwijlinterest verschuldigd ten belope van 0,75% per dag op het onbetaalde factuurbedrag gezien de specifieke trading activiteit onverminderd het recht van ETT op een hogere vergoeding in geval van een hogere werkelijk geleden schade. Ook heeft elke vertraging in de betaling van rechtswege en zonder voorafgaande ingebrekestelling tot gevolg dat een forfaitaire vergoeding ten bedrage van 15% van de factuur wordt aangerekend, onverminderd het recht van ETT op een hogere vergoeding in geval van een hogere werkelijk geleden schade.9.4 Betwistingen omtrent de factuur dienen, op straffe van verval, binnen de 5 dagen na factuurdatum door de koper per aangetekend schrijven te worden gemeld aan ETT. ARTIKEL 10: EIGENDOMSOVERDRACHT & RISICO: 10.1. De geleverde goederen blijven volledige eigendom van ETT tot voldoening door de koper van al hetgeen als tegenprestatie aan ETT verschuldigd is (met inbegrip van de prijs, kosten, intresten en eventuele schadevergoedingen). 10.2 De risico’s van schade, verlies, diefstal of vernietiging van de goederen zullen integraal worden gedragen door de koper vanaf de datum van levering. 10.3. Tot het ogenblik dat de eigendom van de goederen effectief aan de koper is overgedragen conform deze algemene voorwaarden, is het de koper uitdrukkelijk verboden om er op om het even welke manier over te beschikken. ARTIKEL 11: OVERMACHT: 11.1 ETT is bevrijd van rechtswege en niet gehouden tot nakoming van enige verbintenis jegens de koper ingeval van bedrijfsstoringen, stakingen, overmacht, toeval en/of overheidsmaatregelen. 11.2 ETT heeft in dat geval de keuze tussen de verbreking van rechtswege van de overeenkomst zonder schadevergoeding, en anderzijds de verlenging van de termijnen van levering en/of uitvoering met een duur gelijk aan deze der onderbreking. ARTIKEL 12 : GESCHILLENREGELING: 12.1. Alle geschillen tussen partijen behoren uitsluitend tot de bevoegdheid van de Rechtbanken van Koophandel Gent, afdeling Gent, onverminderd het recht van ETT om de gemeenrechtelijk territoriaal bevoegde rechtbank te vatten. 12.2. Alle overeenkomsten tussen partijen worden uitsluitend beheerst door het Belgisch recht. De toepassing van het Weens Koopverdrag van 11 april 1980 wordt uitdrukkelijk uitgesloten.
